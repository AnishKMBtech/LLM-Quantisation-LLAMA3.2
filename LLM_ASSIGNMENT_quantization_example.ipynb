        "[GGUF](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/gguf) is a specific format developed by Georgi Gerganov in [GGML](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml?tab=readme-ov-file), specifically for the [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) library. It has become a popular way of storing and distributing language models for a variety of downstream tasks, and comes with built in quantization capabilities.\n",

K represents the [k-quants quantization method](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/1684), a specific quantization method developed for LLMs that handles different parts of the model differently based on their sensitivity to quantization. Here's a simplified writeup of popular methods\n",

        "* `q4_0`: Original quant method, 4-bit.\n",
